# SplitYourBill
We are thrilled to announce the initial release of Easy Split, a powerful expense split app designed to simplify bill splitting within group. With Easy Split, you can effortlessly manage shared expenses, ensuring fairness and convenience for everyone involved.

Key Features:

1. Group Creation and Expense Management:
Easy Split allows users to create groups and seamlessly add expenses to each group. Whether you're splitting bills with friends, roommates, or colleagues, Easy Split makes it easy to track and manage shared expenses. Create multiple groups for different purposes and organize expenses accordingly.

2. Automatic Calculation of Owed Amounts:
Gone are the days of manual calculations and disputes over who owes what. Easy Split intelligently calculates how much each person owes and gets based on the entered expenses. The app takes into account the amount, distribution, and any adjustments made, ensuring accurate and fair expense distribution among group members.

3. Expense Notes:
Keep track of important details and information related to individual expenses with Easy Split's note-taking feature. You can add descriptions, reminders, or any other relevant information to expenses within the group. This ensures that all relevant information is readily available and helps in clarifying any confusion or discrepancies.

4. Current Expense Summary:
Stay informed about the financial status of your groups with Easy Split's current expense summary. The app's home page always displays an up-to-date summary of the current expenses, including the total amount, who owes money, and who is owed. This provides a quick and convenient overview of the group's financial situation at a glance.

We are excited to release Easy Split and look forward to simplifying your bill-splitting experience. We value your feedback and suggestions for improving the app. Please feel free to reach out to our support team with any questions or concerns.

Thank you for choosing Easy Split!
